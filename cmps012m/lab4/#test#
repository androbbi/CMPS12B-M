ega Banette is gifted with the combination of Prankster and Destiny Bond, being the only Pokemon in the game with access to this. In conjunction with Taunt, this allows Mega Banette to shut down the majority of setup sweepers in the tier, making it extremely difficult to stop. In addition to these moves, Banette also has access to a handful of other useful support moves, as well as a Ghost typing, letting it spinblock successfully. Unfortunately, distinct drawbacks exist when opting to use Mega Banette. Not only is it predictable in its best role, but it also has difficulty fitting all of its desired moves into one moveset. Mega Banette's downfalls are worsened by the fact that it has poor stat distribution, no form of reliable recovery, and the fact that Prankster doesn't activate on the turn that Banette Mega Evolves. Despite its faults, Banette is definitely a Pokemon to be feared in OU.

Moves
========

Mega Banette's access to Destiny Bond stands out due to its ability, Prankster. In conjunction with Taunt, it effectively neuters all boosting threats, even if it requires Mega Banette to sacrifice itself. Taunt forces opponents to attack Mega Banette, which allows it to pull off a successful Destiny Bond while also preventing opponents from crippling Mega Banette with status. Will-O-Wisp gives Mega Banette the ability to impede most physical attackers, while also gaining a useful priority boost thanks to its ability. Outside of its status moves, Mega Banette's surprisingly high base Attack stat of 165 allows it to make good use of Knock Off. With its enhanced mechanics this generation, Knock Off is capable of dealing large amounts of damage while depriving opponents of their items. Shadow Claw is an alternate move in the final slot which deals more damage than Knock Off, but comes at the cost of not removing items.

Outside of the moves listed, Mega Banette can use Pain Split as a form of recovery to replace Will-O-Wisp or Knock Off. Because Mega Banette is at risk of being OHKOed before it is able to use a Prankster Destiny Bond, Protect is also usable in the last slot. However, the cost of losing one of its other moves is often too much.

Set Details
========

With heavy investment in Special Defense and a Careful nature, Mega Banette is given adequate special bulk; thanks to Will-O-Wisp, it doesn't need to worry as much about physical attackers. The given EV spread of 252 HP / 216+ SpD makes Mega Banette bulky enough to escape an OHKO from a Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse from Greninja after Stealth Rock. Although Frisk can be replaced with the more situational Insomnia, being able to scout other Pokemon's items before Banette Mega Evolves gives the user knowledge of what set the opponent is using, and is generally the better choice.

Usage Tips
========

This set takes a defensive supporting role, ensuring that opposing Pokemon are kept in check. Despite taking a defensive role, Mega Banette should not be used as a wall because it simply lacks the tools to do so, particularly due to its low defenses and lack of a recovery move. Will-O-Wisp should be used as Mega Banette's main form of disruption when not using Destiny Bond and gives it a job outside of checking setup sweepers, whereas Taunt can be used not only to force Pokemon into attacking Banette, but also prevent Pokemon from setting up.

Mega Evolving as soon as possible is generally a good idea, as it allows the preservation of a Prankster Destiny Bond to be used at a later point in the game. In order to Mega Evolve safely, bringing Banette in against Pokemon who are slower or have little offensive presence is a good idea in order to take as little damage as possible. Examples of Pokemon that Banette can switch into with relative ease include Forretress and Skarmory.

Because Destiny Bond is active until Banette's next attack, alternation between Destiny Bond and Knock Off against faster setup sweepers almost always ensures that the opposing Pokemon will be eliminated. However, if the opponent has access to priority moves and is faster than Banette, this strategy will be useless. It is also good to keep in mind that opponents can bypass Mega Banette's combination of Taunt and Destiny Bond with good prediction.

Team Options
========

Above all, teammates that can restore Mega Banette's health are particularly valuable. Sylveon has access to Wish and covers Mega Banette's Dark-type weakness. Chansey and Blissey are also capable of passing massive Wishes to Mega Banette while being able to cure status with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. Other team members that appreciate Mega Banette as a partner are those that are easy to set up on. For instance, Forretress can stack entry hazards freely, and opponents that would otherwise be inclined to set up on it are deterred by Mega Banette's Prankster-aided Destiny Bond. Lastly, Pokemon that use Volt Switch and U-turn can allow Mega Banette to jump into the fray without hassle; for this reason, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Genesect are all ideal partners.

Other Options
########

Banette can make decent use of its titanic Attack stat after Mega Evolution through the use of an offensive set. With access to Phantom Force, Shadow Claw, and Sucker Punch, Mega Banette could attempt to dish out as much damage as possible before going down with a Prankster Destiny Bond to differentiate itself from other physical attackers. In a similar vein, Banette can opt to use Trick Room to take advantage of its middling Speed stat and simultaneously support teammates; however, this role is generally best suited to other Pokemon that can activate Trick Room more reliably.

Support sets may also choose to use Substitute in tandem with either Disable or Pain Split to force switches and be a general nuisance, but the lack of Leftovers recovery and cost to its moveslots generally makes this an inferior choice. Thunder Wave also works as an option over Will-O-Wisp. Finally, Mega Banette could potentially utilize a set with Rest and Sleep Talk with priority in an attempt to mend its recovery problems.

Checks & Counters
########

**Priority**: Destiny Bond makes Mega Banette an extremely hard Pokemon to KO without its check or counter fainting itself. As a result, sure counters are hard to come by. However, Pokemon that can bypass Banette's own priority make excellent choices for beating it. For example, Talonflame can make use of its natural immunity to burn and priority Flying-type moves to dispose of Mega Banette quite effectively; however, Talonflame has difficulty switching into Knock Off or Shadow Claw. Thundurus can outright prevent Mega Banette from using any of its status moves with its own, faster Taunt and proceed to attack it.

**Dark-types**: Most Dark-type Pokemon are capable of defeating Mega Banette in practice, but a lot of these Pokemon may also be KOed by Destiny Bond at the same time. One of the best counters to Mega Banette is Mega Absol, which can reflect Taunt and Will-O-Wisp with Magic Bounce, and OHKO it with its Dark-type STAB. Tyranitar can trap Mega Banette with Pursuit or inflict massive damage with Crunch, though it hates being burned. Some Pokemon, such as Sableye and Mandibuzz, can exploit Mega Banette's high base Attack stat with a powerful Foul Play. 

**Fire-types**: By virtue of their natural immunity to Will-O-Wisp, Fire-type Pokemon make for good Mega Banette checks. Defensive Heatran can enter the field on a predicted Will-O-Wisp and hit Mega Banette hard with Lava Plume, or force you into a mind game with Destiny Bond otherwise. Other Fire-type Pokemon, such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard X, can force Mega Banette into a guessing game provided they have a recovery move.
