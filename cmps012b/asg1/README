This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Antony Robbins androbbi@ucsc.edu
Partner: Brandon Gomez brlgomez@ucsc.edu

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individualâ€™s effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Antony Robbins spent 0 hours working alone.
Brandon Gomez spent 1 hours working alone.
We spent 16 hours working together.
Antony Robbins spent 8 hours driving.
Brandon Gomez spent 8 hours driving.
